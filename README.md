# Reader-XAML-Mockup
A XAML mockup of my PDF Reader concept that I made back in December 2020.

Do note that I'm not very good at this so there will be a lot of silly mistakes xD. Please create an issue, if you find an error / mistake / have an idea.

## Note
I've only done the Home Page and the Search area, hopefully I'll make more screens such as the settings one and tags and as I said, there will be a lot silly mistakes as I'm only a beginner at this point, please create an issue, if you want to improve something or find an error or mistake.


## Special Thanks

Also special thanks to, FireCubeStudios, Ahmed Walid and many others on [Fluent Design Hub Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YU7Qt8hRDF) for helping me out!
